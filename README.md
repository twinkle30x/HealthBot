# HealthBot

This project was made for my Operating Systems lab project. I worked in a team with a colleague. 

A bot that is linked to the myPhpAdmin database will randomly create a Patient and an Environment, 
and if there is enough space in the database, it will store the results.

To retrieve the data from the database, we used queries.

Can be interacted with text and speech , though, to be honest, the speech recognition isn't very good.
